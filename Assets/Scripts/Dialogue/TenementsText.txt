SHOTGUN
This is Troy's shotgun...
...but where's Troy?

BARRED ENTRANCE
This door's busted.
No way I can get in through here.
Maybe somewhere else?

REAL ENTRANCE
Looks like the basement window can be broken...

PISTOL
Oh thank god.
Has a few bullets in here.
. . . wait, isn't this Jackie's piece?
Where is he?
