PISTOL
Oh thank god.
Has a few bullets in here.
. . . wait, isn't this Jackie's piece?
Where is he?
Where is everybody?

UZI
Jay's uzi . . .
I remember he had it in his lap, . . .
than took it with him when we got to the house.
. . . Maybe?
I need to find these people, man.
At least I can take some of those things out quicker with this.
. . . Just need to watch the ammo.

SHOTGUN
Troy had this shotgun, if I remember right.
Now he's gone.
Like everyone else.
I can still end any of those freaks in one shot with this . . .
. . .  not a lot of shells in it, though.
